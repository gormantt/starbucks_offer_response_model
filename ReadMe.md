## Author: Timothy Gorman
## Date: 2023.03.30
## Project: Starbucks Classification Model

# Data
The raw data can be found in the workspace provided with the udacity course. and is also here in this repo under the "data" folder.  The curated datasets (after preprocessing and feature engineering) can be found in under the "data/curated_data" folder.

# Notebooks
For the notebooks used for exploratory data analyis, feature engineering, and training see notebooks "01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb", "02_Feature_Generation.ipynb", and "03_model_training.ipynb", respectively.

# Submission Documents
To find the submission pdf document, "project_submission.pdf"  and the proposal pdf document, "proposal.pdf", look under the "submission documents" folder.  A link the proposal review can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/3973632).

# Trained Models
Models binaries generated in "03_model_training.ipynb" can be found under the "trained_models" folder. For a more in-depth discussion 

# So you want to recreate my models?
Start with notebook 01 and sequentially move through notebook 03.

# Dependencies and Software Requirements
These notebooks in this repository need to run in AWS Sagemaker Studio using the default "Data Science" Image, the Python3 kernel, and an "ml.t3.medium" instance.
